    <title>Object Data type</title>
    <!-- Object is a non primitive data type used in javascript to show candidates data/ for other puposes.
    First we mention the property(like the name of object or color) and then it's value(age,salary etc).
    We use curly braces for object. we can use array in object and object in array.
     in this project I will use some object's(women) properties and values -->

        var obj = {
        name: "Sania",
        age: 20,
        email: "saniamalik@gmail.com"
    }
    document.write(obj + "<br>");
    // it wouldn't get print like array so we have to mention the properties we want to print
        document.write(obj.name + " " + obj.age + " " + obj.email + " ");
        document.write("<br>");
        // we can also do it with for in loop(we use for in loop for object)
    for(a in obj){
        document.write(obj[a] + " ");
    }
        document.write("<br>");
    // now let's use two variables to get the object's property and value with for loop
    var Names = ["Mehwish","Umar", "Iqra"];
    var Ages = [19,22,26];
    for(b=0;b<Names.length;b++){
        document.write("Age of" + " " + Names[b] + " " + "is" + " " + Ages[b] + "<br>")
